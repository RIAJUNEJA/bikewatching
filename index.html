  The underlying map shows Boston area roads and labels of neighborhoods. You can pan and zoom around as you would with services like Google Maps.
  <br>
  <br>
  The green lines show bike lanes. We will be importing two datasets from the city governments of Boston and Cambridge for this.
  <br>
  <br>
  The circles represent individual BlueBike stations. The size of each circle represents the amount of traffic at each station, while the color represents whether most traffic is entering or leaving the station. We will be using two datasets from BlueBikes to analyze bike traffic from about 260,000 individual rides from March 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is a slider at the top right that allows the user to filter the data for traffic at specific times of the day, and the circles will change size and color accordingly.
